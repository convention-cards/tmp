    question: "How do I generate a convention card?",
    answer:
      "When you have defined a system you can then generate a convention card by going to the convention cards section of the system designer. From there you select the NBO (EBU/ACBL/WBF) you want to generate a card for and fill in the details specific for that card. Once you have finished we will give you a link which you can use to share your convention card when playing online. Any changes to your system will automatically be reflected on your convention card.",
